## About me:
I am a cheerful but responsible person.

After receiving higher education in the profession of "highly efficient material processing processes"

I worked as an engineer-constructor. after a while, I began to work as a foreman of a mechanical workshop, but realized that working with people was not mine. 
and I started to master programming on machine tools.
For 3 years now I have been working on machines, writing programs in g-cods and in the sinumerik shell.

now I want to learn something new, that's why I started learning JS/FRONT-END
