## About me:
I am a cheerful but responsible person.


After receiving higher education in the profession of "Highly Efficient Material Processing Processes".


I worked as an Engineer-Constructor. After a while, I began to work as a Foreman of a mechanical workshop,


but realized that working with people was not mine.


And I started to master programming on machine tools.


For 3 years now I have been working on machines, writing programs in G-Cods and in the Sinumerik shell.


Now I want to learn something new, that's why I started learning JS/FRONT-END.



## Skils:
* Quick self-study

* KOMPAS 3D
* Programming in the Sinumerik shell


## Eanglish level: B1
* Studied at: Light Eanglish
